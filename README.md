# Python Practice Projects

This repository is where I document my journey learning Python. I'm focusing on building things and writing code every day to get better at programming.

## About

I'm learning Python by doing. My approach is simple: write code daily, build small programs, and learn through practice. This repo contains my daily exercises, small projects, and experiments as I work my way from beginner to intermediate Python.

## What's here

- Daily Python scripts organized by day
- Small projects that put concepts into practice
- Exercises covering different Python topics
- Games and simple utilities I've built

## What I'm learning

Right now I'm working through:

- Variables and data types
- If statements and loops
- Writing functions
- Lists, dictionaries, and strings
- Reading and writing files
- Basic object-oriented programming
- Building small games and tools

## Why I'm doing this

I created this repository to track my progress and stay consistent. I believe the best way to learn programming is by actually writing code, not just watching tutorials or reading books. Every project here represents real practice and problem-solving.

## How it's organized

```
├── day_01/
│   └── script.py
├── day_02/
│   └── script.py
├── projects/
│   ├── calculator/
│   ├── todo_list/
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

## Running the code

If you want to try any of these scripts:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ludwig-siisi07/PythonProjects.git
   ```

2. Go to a project folder
   ```bash
   cd PythonProjects/day_01
   ```

3. Run it
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

Most scripts only need Python 3 installed. If a project needs extra packages, I'll mention it in that folder.

## Note

This is a learning repository, so you'll see mistakes and code that could be better. That's intentional. I'm documenting everything, including the rough parts, because that's how learning actually works.
